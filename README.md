## Hi there 👋

I’m **Samuel**, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer based in Nigeria 🇳🇬.

I build and train machine learning models to solve problems that feel personal, broken, or quietly ignored.  
If something bugs me enough, I try to teach a machine how to fix it.

### 🧠 What I work with
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Transformers**
- **Hugging Face**
- **Langchain**
- **Streamlit**

### 🌱 Currently
- Deepening my understanding of ML systems and model deployment  
- Learning by building, breaking, and rebuilding  

### 🤝 Open to
- Collaborating on ML or AI projects  
- Learning from people who enjoy solving real problems  

If you care about thoughtful engineering, practical ML, or turning ideas into working systems, we’ll probably get along.
